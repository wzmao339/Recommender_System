# Recommender_System

This is my notes of learning recommender system algorithms. I will post summaries and implementations of some classic papers. The current paper list:
1) Application of Dimensionality Reduction in Recommender System - A Case Study
2) Item-Based Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Algorithms
3) Matrix Factorization Techniques for Recommender Systems
4) Factorization Machines
5) Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations
